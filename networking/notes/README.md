# Networking Notes

**Networking** refers to the practice of connecting **computers** and other devices (such as phones, printers, and servers) to enable communication and resource sharing.

### Why Are Networks Important?
1. **Foundation of Communication**: Networks are the foundation that enables communication between devices.
2. **Resource Sharing**: They allow us to share resources and exchange data (e.g., files, printers).
3. **Internet Access**: Networks enable browsing, streaming, and online communication.
4. **Application Connectivity**: They serve as the backbone for app connectivity and data transfer.

---

### Factors That Influence Networks
- **Geographical Area**: The physical size the network covers (small or large).
- **Number of Users**: The number of devices or people connected.
- **Services**: Types of services available (e.g., file sharing, internet access, applications).

---

### Network Types by Size and Function

**Local Area Network (LAN):**
- **Size**: Small (e.g. home, office, school).
- **Purpose**: Connects devices in a small geographical area for resource sharing.
- **Example**: An office network where multiple computers are connected for file sharing.

**Wide Area Network (WAN):**
- **Size**: Large (spanning cities, countries, or continents).
- **Purpose**: Connects multiple LANs and MANs over a large geographical area.
- **Example**: The internet is the largest WAN.

### Networking in DevOps

1. Server interaction - communcation between servers and apps
2. Deployment of apps and updating them
3. Management and monitoring infrastructure 
4. Optimisation - enhances troubleshooting performance and scalability

### Backbone of networks:

| Device    | Function                                                        | Example                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Switch    | Connects multiple devices within a LAN and ensures efficient dataflow between them | Connects phones, printers, and laptops etc    |
| Router    | Directs messages between networks and connects different networks, ensuring data reaches the correct destination | Connects home network to internet |
| Firewall  | Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, securing network by enforcing rules and blocking unauthorised access | Protects a company network from external threats |

### IP address & MAC address

- **IP address** is a unique identifier for devices in a network, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other

  - There are 2 types:
