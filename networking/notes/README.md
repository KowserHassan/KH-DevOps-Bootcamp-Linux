2. **Resource Sharing**: They allow us to share resources and exchange data (e.g., files, printers).
3. **Internet Access**: Networks enable browsing, streaming, and online communication.
4. **Application Connectivity**: They serve as the backbone for app connectivity and data transfer.

### Factors That Influence Networks
- **Geographical Area**: The physical size the network covers (small or large).
- **Number of Users**: The number of devices or people connected.
- **Services**: Types of services available (e.g., file sharing, internet access, applications).

### Network Types by Size and Function

**Local Area Network (LAN):**
- **Size**: Small (e.g. home, office, school).
- **Purpose**: Connects devices in a small geographical area for resource sharing.
- **Example**: An office network where multiple computers are connected for file sharing.

**Wide Area Network (WAN):**
- **Size**: Large (spanning cities, countries, or continents).
- **Purpose**: Connects multiple LANs and MANs over a large geographical area.
- **Example**: The internet is the largest WAN.
